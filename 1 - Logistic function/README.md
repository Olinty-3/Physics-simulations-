# Logistic Function 

The logistic funtion is a simple aproach to describe the evolution of a population: 

$$ x_{j+1} = 4r x_j (1 - x_j) $$

However we are not interested in the evolution of a population, but in the behavior of the solutions when the value of $r$ varies. For small values of $r$ $x_j$ would tend to the same solution for large values of $j$ independenly of the initial value, $x_0$. There is an $r$ from which you'll get two different solutions depending on $x_0$. As $r$ grows so does the number of solutions until you get a chaotic sistem.
